# Overview
This Jupyter Notebook explores and visualizes the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in data science. The notebook demonstrates how to load the dataset, inspect its structure, and create visualizations to understand the relationships between different features of the iris flowers.

# Contents
Importing Libraries: The notebook uses pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

Loading the Dataset: The Iris dataset is loaded using seaborn's built-in dataset loader.

Data Inspection: The notebook displays the shape of the dataset, column names, and the first few rows to give an overview of the data.

# Visualizations:
Scatter Plot: A scatter plot of sepal_length vs. sepal_width, colored by species, to visualize the relationship between these features.

Histogram: A histogram of petal_length to show the distribution of petal lengths across the dataset.

# Key Insights
The dataset contains 150 samples with 5 features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, and species.

The scatter plot reveals distinct clusters for each iris species, indicating that sepal length and width can help differentiate species.

The histogram of petal lengths shows a bimodal distribution, suggesting that petal length is a strong feature for species classification.
